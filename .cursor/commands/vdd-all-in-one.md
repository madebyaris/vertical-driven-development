# Build Complete App/Feature with VDD Principles (All-in-One)

## Objective

This command is an alias for `/vdd-build`. When the user invokes `/vdd-all-in-one [feature-name] [description] [--implement]`, execute the same workflow as `/vdd-build`.

## Steps

Follow the exact same steps as defined in `vdd-build.md`:

1. Parse user input (feature-name, description, --implement flag)
2. Analyze business requirements
3. Identify vertical slices
4. Create master plan structure
5. Generate master plan documents
6. Process each vertical slice with SDD workflow
7. Implement if --implement flag is present

## VDD Principles

Same as `/vdd-build`:
- Business Requirement First
- Vertical Slice Organization
- Simplicity First
- Change-Focused Development
- Build Only What's Needed

## Expected Output

Same structure and output as `/vdd-build` command.

## Notes

This command provides the same functionality as `/vdd-build` - it's an alias for convenience. All instructions and principles from `vdd-build.md` apply here.
